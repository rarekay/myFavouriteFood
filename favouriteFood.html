    <h1>My Favourite Food</h1>
    <p>When it comes to favourites, I tend not to have one so I don't 
        make the other options feel left out. For this lesson though,
        I'll be taking us through how I make my <strong>Yam and Egg</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>The Origin</h2>
    <p>Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus 
        Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers. Yams 
        are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption 
        of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions, 
        especially in West Africa, South America and the Caribbean, Asia, 
        and Oceania. 
        Eggs are somewhat general and the origins of frying comes from 
        Ancient Egypt and French cultures.
        
        Yam and egg together is one of the breakfast staples in Nigeria or 
        should I say weekend breakfast.

        <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Yam</strong></p>
    <p>Slice yam into about 1-inch size and peel the skin off.
        Rinse in clean water till water runs clear and no residue in 
        water.Put yam in a pan, add enough water to cover it, add salt 
        and place on medium heat and cook till soft. Test with a fork, 
        if it goes through, then the yam should be soft enough. 
        Drain water from yam if you want.</p>
    <p><strong>Egg</strong></p>
    <p>Break eggs into a shallow bowl, whisk till egg white and egg yolk 
        are well combined, add salt and whisk to combine then set it aside<br>
        Place a frying pan on a medium/low heat, add the vegetable oil, 
        heat for about 2-3 minutes and then add the chopped peppers and onions 
        (this should sizzle) and cook for about 4-5 minutes or till oil 
        floats on the sauce, add salt, seasoning, curry and thyme. Stir 
        to combine ingredient with sauce and also avoid sauce sticking to 
        the pan.<br>
        Add whisked eggs to sauce and leave for about a minute, this will allow
        the egg to set a bit. Stir to scramble egg. Serve egg sauce with boiled 
        yam immediately.
